## How to run on modern systems

The game is programmed for DOS and will not run natively on recent Windows versions.
To run it on modern systems like Linux, Windows or MacOS you'll need a DOS emulator.
I recommend [Dosbox](https://www.dosbox.com/), which is available on most platforms.


## Development

If you are interessted in the development of the game hop over to the [github](https://github.com/TerrySoba/DosPlatformGame) page.
